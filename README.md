# e.164-generator
a WIP e.164 conforming phone number generator library written in java.
It's considered WIP since it currently only produces '+49'(Germany)-prefixed numbers.
Also, it currently doesn't consider single-territory country codes (e.g. isle of man)

Next task is creating method overloads for generate() in order to be able to specify the length of the number to generate.
